You've learned a bit of HTML and some CSS, but you have likely only used it in bits and pieces so far, adding or modifying content in exercises or pre-existing files. Here, you are going to take another step forward by building an entire page from scratch. You will also get some practice using Git.

There are two parts to this exercise, one focused on HTML and another focused on CSS. HTML makes up the structure and content of web pages, while CSS dictates the visual style.

Best practices dictate that these should be kept as separate as possible. To that end, we'll build the HTML portion of our page first, and only afterwards will we add a few styles with CSS. This will help us avoid adding HTML elements simply to change the style of our page.
