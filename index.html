            <h1>My experience at <a href="https://shellhacks.net/">Shellhacks</a> 2018</h1>
            <p>As a someone who's learning to be a Software Developer,
                I have joined a slew of slack channels, and many of their members were talking about going ot Shellhacks.
                So, I decided to sign up given the opportunity to network and learn some new hacks. Although, I could not attend
                all the workshops,
                but those I did attend, I enjoyed them thouroughly </p>
            
            <h2>What is Shellhacks?</h2>
            <p>Well, Shellhacks is simply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a>, it
                runs from September 14-16 at FIU in Miami, Fl. The people who came up with the name were debating
                how would a turtles-themed Hackaton should be called. upon brainstorming and since theyâ€™re in Miami, so they
                decided to
                call it Shellhacks given the city of Miami proximity to the beach and a reference on the computer shells(Geeks). I
                paraphrased all that from their site.</p>

                <h4>Robotic Process Automation</h4>
                <p>This is workshop was about how to automate certain process. For exampple, instead of going everyday to pull a report
                    from a database,
                    then save it as a csv to import in an excel sheet to create pivot tables and graphs(tedious and time-consuming).

                <p>The Unity was quite interesting and equate to Gaming industry various technical fields that could arrive from
                    learning Unity. I wanted to learn
                    about the technology becasue I have taken 3D design course where I workd in Maya and in 3D Blender. The latter, I
                    have moree experience in modeling different car models.
